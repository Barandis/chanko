 * re-queue it.

/**
 * Invokes an async function acting as a process.

 * This is purely a convenience function, driven by the fact that it's necessary
 * to use an IIFE to invoke an anonymous async function, and that's not very
 * aesthetically pleasing. It does no more than invoke the passed function, but
 * that at least releases us from the need to put the empty parentheses after
 * the function definition.
 *
 * A named async function can simply be invoked (without being an IIFE) and
 * doesn't benefit from this convenience.
 *
 * Anonymous process without `go`:
 * ```
 * (async () => {
 *   ... do some process stuff here ...

 *   ... do some process stuff here ...
 * });

 * @memberof module:chanko~Chanko
 * @param {function} fn The async function being used as a process.
 * @param {...*} args Arguments that are sent to the async function when it's
 *     invoked.
