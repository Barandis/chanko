/**
 * A function that transforms data and can be composed with other transducers
 * into a single transducer. The transducers themselves are provided by other
 * libraries; the only involvement of this librar is as a consumer of

 *
 * Transducers work by having step functions that are known via protocol, and it
 * is these step functions that take a value at a time to be transformed as
 * their arguments. The arguments to the transducers themselves are other
 * transducers that are then composed into a single transducer, which is then
 * returned. These values need not concern a user of ths library; just pass a
 * transducer to `{@link module:chanko.chan|chan}` or
 * `{@link module:chanko.transChan|transChan}` and everything else will be
 * handled.

 * @param {module:chanko~transducer} xform A transducer to chain this transducer
 *     to.
 * @return {module:chanko~transducer} A new transducer consisting of the
