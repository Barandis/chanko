 * Creates an iterator that is also a transducer, transforming its collection

 * the {@link module:xduce.sequence|sequence} function when the input is an

 *
 * This object supports non-1-to-1 correspondences between input and output
 * values. For example, a filter transformation might return fewer output
 * elements than were in the input collection, while a repeat transformation
 * will return more. In either case, `next` in this class will return one
 * element per call.

/**
 * Transforms the elements of the input collection and reduces them into an

 *
 * This is the lowest-level of the transduction functions that is likely to see
 * regular use. It does not assume anything about the reducer, as it asks for it
 * to be passed explicitly. This means that any kind of collection can be
 * produced, since the reducer is not tied to the input collection in any way.
 *
 * `transduce` also will accept an initial value for the resulting collection as
 * the optional last parameter. If this parameter isn't present, then the
 * initial value is determined from the transducer init protocol property on the
 * reducer. Note however that many reducers may not provide an initial value,
 * and in those cases it will *have* to be passed as a parameter.
 *
 * ```
 * import { map, transduce } from "@chanko/xduce";
 * import { protocols as p } from "@chanko/core";
 *
 * const xform = map(x => x + 1);
 *
 * const arrayReducer = {
 *   [p.init]() { return []; },
 *   [p.result](x) { return x; },
 *   [p.step](acc, x) {
 *     acc.push(x);
 *     return acc;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * const stringReducer = {
 *   [p.init]() { return ''; },
 *   [p.result](x) { return x; },
 *   [p.step](acc, x) { return acc + x; }
 * };
 *
 * let result = transduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], xform, arrayReducer);
 * console.log(result);   // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *
 * result = transduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], xform, stringReducer);
 * console.log(result);   // -> "23456"
 *
 * result = transduce('12345', xform, arrayReducer);
 * console.log(result);   // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *
 * result = transduce('12345', xform, stringReducer);
 * console.log(result);   // -> "23456"
 * ```
 *
 * These examples illustrate a number of important concepts. First of all, the
 * transducer function is independent of the type of the collection; the same
 * transducer function is used no matter the type of input or output
 * collections. Secondly, two reducers are defined. These are objects that
 * conform to the transducer protocol (see the documentation on
 * `{@link module:core.protocols}`) and that know how to produce the output
 * collection of choice. In this case, the reducers know how to create new
 * arrays and strings (the `init` protocol) and how to add elements to arrays
 * and strings (the `step` protocol). Because these reducers do have `init`
 * protocol properties, the `transduce` calls do not require explicit initial
 * collections.
 *
 * The final point is that `transduce` can accept any kind of iterable
 * collection, and by passing in the proper reducer, it can produce any kind of
 * output collection. The same `transduce` function and the same map transformer
 * is used in all four examples, despite the input/output combination being
 * different in all four.
 *
 * The `reducer` parameter *can* be a reducer function instead of a reducer
 * object. If this is the case, the `init` parameter is required because a
 * function cannot define an initial value itself.
 *
 * The `init` collection doesn't have to be empty. If it isn't, the elements
 * that are already in it are retained and the transformed input elements are
 * reduced into the collection normally.
 *
 * Of course, the examples are not really necessary - the same thing could be
 * accomplished using `{@link module:xduce.into|into}` without having to create
 * the reducers (strings and arrays passed to `{@link module:xduce.into|into}`
 * as targets know how to reduce themselves already).
