 * @typedef {object} ProtocolMap
 * @memberof module:core
 * @private
 * @property {Symbol} init The `reducer/init` protocol. This is used to mark
 *     functions that initialize a target collection before adding items to it.
 * @property {Symbol} step The `reducer/step` protocol. This is used to mark
 *     functions that are used in the reducer's step process, where objects are
 *     added to the target collection one at a time.
 * @property {Symbol} result The `reducer/result` protocol. This is used to mark
 *     functions that take the final result of the step process and return the
 *     final form to be output. This is optional; if the reducer does not want
 *     to transform the final result, it should just return the result of its
 *     chained reducer's `result` function.
 * @property {Symbol} completed The `reducer/completed` protocol. The presence
 *     of this key on an object indicates that its transformation has been
 *     completed. It is used internally to mark collections whose
 *     transformations conclude before every object is iterated over (as in
 *     `{@link module:xduce.take}` transducers.) It is of little use beyond
 *     transducer authoring.
 * @property {Symbol} value The `reducer/value` protocol. This is used
 *     internally to mark properties that contain the value of a completed
 *     transformation. It is of little use beyond transducer authoring.
