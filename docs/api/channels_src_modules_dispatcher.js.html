/**
 * This is the place where the new JS tasks are actually created. A queue is
 * maintained for them, and as each batch of tasks are completed, the next ones
 * run. As each process runs, it adds tasks to be run to the queue, which are
 * each run in their own JS task.
 *
 * The function that spawns the new JS task depends on environment. The
 * `setImmediate` function is preferred as it's the fastest, not waiting for
 * event queues to empty before spawning the new process. However, it is not JS
 * standard and currently only works in IE and Node. If `setImmediate` isn't
 * available, an attempt is made to use `MessageChannel`'s `onMessage` is tried
 * next. If that is also not available, then `setTimeout` with `0` delay is
 * used, which is available everywhere but which is the least performant of all
 * of the solutions.
 *
 * There are other possibilities for creating processes, but they were rejected
 * as obsolete (`process.nextTick` and `onreadystatechange`) or unnecessary
 * (`window.postMessage`, which works like `MessageChannel` but doesn't work in
 * Web Workers).
 *
 * It is notable and important that we act as good citizens here. This
 * dispatcher is capable of taking control of the JavaScript engine until
 * thousands, millions, or more tasks are handled. But that could cause the
 * system event loop to have to wait an unacceptable amount of time. So we limit
 * ourselves to a batch of tasks at a time, and if there are still more to be
 * run, we let the event loop run before that next batch is processed.
 *
 * The dispatcher is **global**. There is a single instance that runs for all
 * channels and processes. This is the only element of the system that works
 * like this.
