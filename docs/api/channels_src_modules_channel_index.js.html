/**
 * An implementation of channels. These channels are essentially queues that
 * hold instructions waiting for the next available async function to process
 * them. They can be buffered, which is accomplished using the buffer functions
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.fixed|fixed}`,
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.dropping|dropping}`, and
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.sliding|sliding}`.
 *
 * Channels do not interact with JS tasks or the dispatcher in any meaningful
 * way. They're just here to hold tasks which may themselves then cause new JS
 * tasks to be created via the dispatcher.
 *
 * Channels may have transducers associated with them. The transducers are
 * expected to follow the same conventions as any of the popular transducer
 * libraries. Explicit support is required because channels wouldn't play well
 * with the normal way of making an object support transduction, for two
 * different reasons.
 *
 * * Transducers require the ability to create a new, empty collection of the
 *   same type as the input collection. In this case, that would mean creating a
 *   new channel, meaning that the output channel (from which the transformed
 *   values are received) would be different than the input channel (where
 *   values are sent).
 * * If we somehow get over that requirement and keep all action on the same
 *   channel, we can't take values from the channel, transform them, and put
 *   them back. This would potentially change the order of values in the channel
 *   since we are dealing with asynchronous processes.
 *
 * The explicit support means a transducer is directly associated with a
 * channel. When a value is sent to the channel, it's first run through the
 * transducer and the transformed value is the one actually put into the
 * channel's buffer. This avoids both of the problems noted above.

/**
 * Creates and returns a new channel.

 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.send|send}`,

 * (`{@link module:chanko/channels.sendAsync|sendAsync}`,
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.recvAsync|recvAsync}`, and
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.selectAsync|selectAsync}`).
 *
 * If a buffer value is provided, it defines what buffer should back the
 * channel. If this is `null` or `0`, the channel will be unbuffered. If it's a
 * positive number, the channel will be buffered by a
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer|FixedBuffer} `of that size. If
 * it's a `{@link module:chanko/channels.Buffer|Buffer}` object, that object
 * will be used as the channel's buffer. If it's missing altogether, the channel
 * will be unbuffered unless a `transducer` option is provided (see below), in
 * which case it will be a
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer|FixedBuffer}` of size 1.
 *
 * `chan` supports transducers by allowing a transducer function to be
 * associated with it. This is passed as the `transducer` option and can only be
 * used if the channel is buffered (otherwise an error is thrown). This
 * transducer function must take another transducer as a parameter (allowing
 * transformers to be chained), and it must return an object conforming to the
 * transducer protocol.
 *
 * Errors in the transformation process can be handled by passing an error
 * handler. This is a function that expects to receive an error object as a
 * parameter and can return a value that is then put onto the channel. If this
 * value is `{@link module:chanko/channels.CLOSED|CLOSED}`, then no value will
 * be put onto the channel upon handler completion.
 *
 * @memberof module:chanko/channels
 * @param {(number|module:chanko/channels.Buffer)} [buffer] The buffer object
 *     that should back this channel. If this is a positive number, a fixed
 *     buffer of that size will be created to back the channel. If it is `0` or
 *     `null`, the new channel will be unbuffered. If it's not present, the new
 *     channel will be unbuffered unless there is a `transducer` option, in in
 *     which case it will be buffered with a size 1
 *     `{@link module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer|FixedBuffer}`.
 * @param {Object} [options] A set of options for configuring the channel's
 *     queue.
 * @param {module:chanko/channels.Transducer} [options.transducer] A transducer
 *     to run each value through before putting it onto the channel. This
 *     function should expect one parameter (another transducer that it's
 *     chained to) and return an object that conforms to the transducer
 *     protocol. If a transducer is provided on an unbuffered channel, an error
 *     will be thrown.
 * @param {module:chanko/channels.ExceptionHandler} [options.handler] An error
 *     handler that is run whenever an error occurs inside a transducer
 *     function. If that happens, this function is called with one parameter,
 *     which is the error object. The value that the handler returns (if it is
 *     not `{@link module:chanko/channels.CLOSED|CLOSED}`) will be put onto the
 *     channel when the handler finishes running.
 * @param {number} [options.maxDirty=64] The maximum number of dirty operations
 *     that can be in the queue before those operations are subject to being
 *     purged. Dirty operations are those that may not be valid anymore because
 *     they were in the list of operations passed to
 *     `{@link module:chanko/channels.select|select}` or
 *     `{@link module:chanko/channels.selectAsync|selectAsync}` but were not
 *     chosen to run. This provides a chance for a very minor performance tweak
 *     and is best left alone.
 * @param {number} [options.maxQueued=1024] The maximum number of operations
 *     that can be queued up at the same time. This prevents infinite loops from
 *     accidentally eating up all of the available memory.
 * @param {number} [options.timer] If this value is present, the channel will be
 *     a timed channel that closes automatically after this number of
 *     milliseconds.
 * @return {module:chanko/channels.Channel} A new channel.

 * The function is a callback that actually defines the difference between
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.send|send}` /
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.recv|recv}` /
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.select|select}` and
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.sendAsync|sendAsync}` /
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.recvAsync|recvAsync}` /
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.selectAsync|selectAsync}`: while the unblocked
 * calls use the callback passed to the function, `send`, `recv`, and `select`
 * simply continue the process where it left off. (This is why `send`, `recv`,
 * and `select` only work inside `async` functions with `await` if the return
 * value is needed, because otherwise there's no process to continue.)
 *
 * This function is provided as the return value of the `commit` method. Calling
 * `commit` has no extra effect with `send` and `recv` operations, but for
 * `select`, it also marks the handler as no longer being active. This means
 * that only one of the operations passed to select can be completed, because
 * after the first one, the handler is no longer active and will not be allowed
 * to process a second operation.
 *
 * If a `send` or `recv` (or equivalent `select` operation) cannot be
 * immediately completed because there isn't a corresponding pending `recv` or
 * `send`, the handler is queued to be run when a new `recv` or `send` becomes
 * available.
 *
 * @typedef Handler
 * @property {boolean} active Whether or not the operation is still active. An
 *     inactive operation is not serviced and will be cleared from the queue on
 *     the next dirty operation purge.
 * @property {function} commit Marks the handler as inactive (so it doesn't run
 *     twice) and returns the callback to be run when the operation completes.

/**
 * A callback function run when a `send` or `recv` operation completes.

 * @callback HandlerCallback
 * @param {*} value The value provided by the channel. In a `recv`, this is the
 *     value received from the channel. In a `send`, this is `true` for a
 *     successful send and `false` if the channel is closed before the send can
 *     complete.
