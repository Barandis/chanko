/**
 * Completes the first operation among the provided operations that comes

 *
 * `operations` is an array whose elements must be channels or two-element
 * sub-arrays of channels and values, in any combination. An operation that is a
 * channel is a take operation on that channel. An operation that is a
 * two-element array is a put operation on that channel using that value.
 * Exactly one of these operations will complete, and it will be the first
 * operation that unblocks.
 *
 * This function *must* be called from within an `async` function and as part of
 * an `await` expression if the return value is needed.
 *
 * When `select` is completed and its process unblocks, its `await` expression
 * evaluates to an object of two properties. The `value` property becomes
 * exactly what would have been returned by the equivalent `await put` or `await
 * take` operation: a boolean in the case of a put, or the taken value in the
 * case of a take. The `channel` property is set to the channel where the
 * operation actually took place. This will be equivalent to the channel in the
 * `operations` array which completed first, allowing the process to unblock.
 *
 * If there is more than one operation already available to complete when the
 * call to `select` is made, the operation with the highest priority will be the
 * one to complete. Regularly, priority is non-deterministic (i.e., it's set
 * randomly). However, if the options object has a `priority` value set to
 * `true`, priority will be assigned in the order of the operations in the
 * supplied array.
 *
 * If all of the operations must block (i.e., there are no pending puts for take
 * operations, or takes for put operations), a default value may be returned.
 * This is only done if there is a `default` property in the options object, and
 * the value of that property becomes the value returned by `await select`. The
 * channel is set to the special value
 * `{@link module:chanko/channels.DEFAULT|DEFAULT}`.

 * @param {object} [options={}] An optional object which can change the behavior
