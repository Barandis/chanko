We can throttle the input channel and make it only offer up the scroll * events once every 100 milliseconds, for instance. * * Throttling is effected by creating a new channel as a throttled destination * for values sent to the source channel. Values will only appear on that * destination channel once per delay interval; other values that are put onto * the source channel in the meantime are discarded. * * The `delay` parameter controls how often a value can become available on the * destination channel. When the first value is sent to the source channel, it * is immediately sent to the destination channel as well and the delay begins. * Any further values sent to the source channel during that delay are *not* * passed through; only when the delay expires is the last input value made * available on the destination channel. The delay then begins again, so that * further inputs are squelched until *that* delay passes. Throttling continues, * only allowing one value through per interval, until an entire interval passes * without input. * * This behavior can be modified by three options: `leading`, `trailing`, and * `cancel`. * * If both `leading` and `trailing` are `true`, values will not be duplicated. * The first value sent to the source channel will be put onto the destination * channel immediately (per `leading`) and the delay will begin, but a value * will only be made available on the destination channel at the end of the * delay (per `trailing`) if *another* input value was sent to the source * channel before the delay expired. * * @memberof module:chanko/operations * @param {module:chanko/channels.Channel} src The source channel. * @param {(number|module:chanko/channels.Buffer)} [buffer=0] A buffer used to * create the destination channel.

Source: channels/src/index.js, line 8 Members &lt;static, constant&gt; CLOSED :Symbol *he value returned from a receive on a channel when that channel is closed and has no more values available. This is a special value that is returned under a certain circumstance, namely when a receive is performed on a closed channel. Because of that, it cannot be returned from a receive on an open channel. For that reason, CLOSED is the only value that cannot be sent onto a channel â€” it would be impossible to distinguish between a legitimate value of CLOSED and an actual closed channel. Type: Symbol Source: channels/src/modules/channel/handler.js, line 52 &lt;static, constant&gt; DEFAULT :Symbol The name of the channel returned from await select or sent to the callback in selectAsync when the default is returned as its value. This only happens when an select / selectAsync call is performed, all operations are initially blocking, and a default option is sent. The immediate response in that situation is { value: options.default, channel: DEFAULT }. Type: Symbol Source: channels/src/modules/channel/select.js, line 25 &lt;static, constant&gt; EMPTY :Symbol The value returned when a queue is read when it's empty. This special value is used because null and undefined are possible legitimate values that can be stored in a queue. Another option is to use some kind of Maybe or Option type, but that requires more effort on the part of the end user to interface with.

Type: Symbol Source: channels/src/modules/dispatcher.js, line 91 See: config Methods &lt;static&gt; chan( [buffer] [, options]) Creates and returns a new channel. By default this channel will be a simple unbuffered, untransformed channel, but that can be changed through options. A channel does not have any externally useful functions. It exists largely to be passed into send, recv, and select invocations, along with their non-blocking variations (sendAsync, recvAsync, and selectAsync). If a buffer value is provided, it defines what buffer should back the channel. If this is null or 0, the channel will be unbuffered. If it's a positive number, the channel will be buffered by a FixedBufferof that size. If it's a Buffer object, that object will be used as the channel's buffer. If it's missing altogether, the channel will be unbuffered unless a transducer option is provided (see below), in which case it will be a FixedBuffer of size 1. chan supports transducers by allowing a transducer function to be associated with it. This is passed as the transducer option and can only be used if the channel is buffered (otherwise an error is thrown). This transducer function must take another transducer as a parameter (allowing transformers to be chained), and it must return an object conforming to the transducer protocol. Errors in the transformation process can be handled by passing an error handler. This is a function that expects to receive an error object as a parameter and can return a value that is then put onto the channel. If this value is CLOSED, then no value will be put onto the channel upon handler completion. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description buffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; The buffer object that should back this channel. If this is a positive number, a fixed buffer of that size will be created to back the channel. If it is 0 or null, the new channel will be unbuffered. If it's not present, the new channel will be unbuffered unless there is a transducer option, in in which case it will be buffered with a size 1 FixedBuffer. options Object &lt;optional&gt; A set of options for configuring the channel's queue. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description transducer module:chanko/channels.Transducer &lt;optional&gt; A transducer to run each value through before putting it onto the channel. This function should expect one parameter (another transducer that it's chained to) and return an object that conforms to the transducer protocol. If a transducer is provided on an unbuffered channel, an error will be thrown. handler module:chanko/channels.ExceptionHandler &lt;optional&gt; An error handler that is run whenever an error occurs inside a transducer function. If that happens, this function is called with one parameter, which is the error object. The value that the handler returns (if it is not CLOSED) will be put onto the channel when the handler finishes running. maxDirty number &lt;optional&gt; 64 The maximum number of dirty operations that can be in the queue before those operations are subject to being purged. Dirty operations are those that may not be valid anymore because they were in the list of operations passed to select or selectAsync but were not chosen to run. This provides a chance for a very minor performance tweak and is best left alone. maxQueued number &lt;optional&gt; 1024 The maximum number of operations that can be queued up at the same time. This prevents infinite loops from accidentally eating up all of the available memory. timer number &lt;optional&gt; If this value is present, the channel will be a timed channel that closes automatically after this number of milliseconds. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 309 Returns: A new channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; channel(result) A convenience function to read the channel out of a select result. This function is not necessary - after all, it's absolutely as correct to simply use result.channel instead of channel(result), but it's provided for consistency with the rest of the function-centric API. Parameters: Name Type Description result module:chanko/channels.SelectResult The result coming from a select operation. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/select.js, line 308 Returns: The channel upon which the select operation completed. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; close(channel) Closes the channel, if it isn't already closed. This immediately returns any buffered values to pending receives. If there are no buffered values (or if they've already been taken by other receives), then all of the rest of the receives are completed with the value of CLOSED. Any pending sends are completed with the value of false. Note that the buffer is not emptied if there are still values remaining after all of the pending receives have been handled. The channel will still provide those values to any future receives, though no new values may be added to the channel. Once the buffer is depleted, any future receives will return CLOSED. Parameters: Name Type Description channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel to be closed. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 622 &lt;static&gt; config(opts) Sets one or more of the dispatcher configuration options. This is advanced setting for the dispatcher that is responsible for queueing up channel operations and processes. It is likely that this function will never need to be called in normal operation. If any recognized options are specified in the options object passed to config, then the option is set to the value sent in. Properties that aren't any of these options are ignored, and any of these options that do not appear in the passed object are left with their current values. Parameters: Name Type Description opts Object A mapping of options to their new values. Extra values (properties that are not options) are ignored. Properties Name Type Argument Description batchSize number &lt;optional&gt; The maximum number of tasks that the dispatcher will run in a single batch (initially, this is 1024). If the number of pending tasks exceeds this, the remaining are not discarded. They're simply run as part of another batch after the current batch completes. dispatchMethod Symbol &lt;optional&gt; The method used to dispatch a process into a separate line of execution. Possible values are SET_IMMEDIATE, MESSAGE_CHANNEL, or SET_TIMEOUT, with the initial being SET_IMMEDIATE. If a method is set but is not available in that environment, then it will silently fall back to the next method that is available. Source: channels/src/modules/dispatcher.js, line 269 Returns: The configuration settings for the dispatcher after any new values have been set. Type module:chanko/channels.DispatcherConfig &lt;static&gt; dropping(size) Creates a dropping buffer of the specified capacity. A dropping buffer silently drops the item being added if the buffer is already at capacity. Since adding a new item will always 'succeed' (even if it succeeds by just ignoring the add), it is never considered full and therefore a put to a channel buffered by a dropping buffer never blocks. This buffer is passed to chan, etc. to create a buffered channel. It is not meant to be used directly. Parameters: Name Type Description size number The number of items that the new buffer can hold before newest items are dropped on add. Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 174 Returns: A new dropping buffer of the specified capacity. Type module:chanko/channels.DroppingBuffer &lt;static&gt; fixed(size) Creates a fixed buffer of the specified capacity. A fixed buffer is a 'normal' buffer, one that stores and returns items on demand. While it is capable of being over-filled, that ability is not used in Chanko. A buffer that is full will cause the next put to its channel to block until at least one item is removed from the buffer. This buffer is passed to chan, etc. to create a buffered channel. It is not meant to be used directly. Parameters: Name Type Description size number The number of items that the new buffer can hold before it's full. Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 108 Returns: A new fixed buffer of the specified capacity. Type module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer &lt;static&gt; go(fn, args) Invokes an async function acting as a process. This is purely a convenience function, driven by the fact that it's necessary to use an IIFE to invoke an anonymous async function, and that's not very aesthetically pleasing. It does no more than invoke the passed function, but that at least releases us from the need to put the empty parentheses after the function definition. A named async function can simply be invoked (without being an IIFE) and doesn't benefit from this convenience. Anonymous process without go: (async () =&gt; { ... do some process stuff here ... })(); Anonymous process with go: go(async () =&gt; { ... do some process stuff here ... }); Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fn function The async function being used as a process. args * &lt;repeatable&gt; Arguments that are sent to the async function when it's invoked. Source: channels/src/modules/process.js, line 82 Returns: The promise returned by the async function. Type Promise &lt;static&gt; isBuffered(channel) Determines whether a channel is buffered. A channel is buffered if a buffer or a number was passed as the first argument of chan or if a transducer is a part of the channel. Parameters: Name Type Description channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel to check. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 414 Returns: Either true if the channel is buffered or false if it isn't. Type boolean &lt;static&gt; isClosed(channel) Determines whether a channel is closed. A closed channel will cause any send operation to return false and any recv operation to return any buffered items that remain, followed by CLOSED. Parameters: Name Type Description channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel to check. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 398 Returns: Either true if the channel is closed or false if it isn't. Type boolean &lt;static&gt; isTimed(channel) Determines whether a channel is timed. A channel is timed if it was created either with the timer option of chan or with the timedChan function. It will automatically close after a certain period of time. Parameters: Name Type Description channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel to check. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 431 Returns: Either true if the channel is timed or false if it isn't. Type boolean &lt;static&gt; join(fns) Joins all of the provided processes into a single process, returning a promise that wraps all of the individual processes' promises. Putting this in an await statement will block until all of the processes complete. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fns function &lt;repeatable&gt; Any number of async functions whose resolutions are being waited for. Source: channels/src/modules/process.js, line 97 Returns: A promise that resolves when all of the processes promises resolve. Type Promise &lt;static&gt; recv() Receives a value from this channel, blocking the async function until a value becomes available to be received (or until the channel closes with no more values on it to be received). This function must be called from within an async function and as part of an await expression. When receive is completed and its function unblocks, its await expression evaluates to the actual value that was received. If the target channel closed, then all of the values already placed onto it are resolved by receive as normal, and once no more values are available, the special value CLOSED is returned. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 554 Returns: A promise that will resolve to the value received from the channel once that receive is completed. If the channel closes without a value being made available, this will resolve to CLOSED. Type Promise &lt;static&gt; recvAsync( [callback]) Receives a value from this channel without blocking. This means that a call to receiveAsync does not go into an await expression, and it is not necessary to use it inside a async function. Rather than blocking until a value becomes available on the channel to be received, this one returns immediately and then invokes the callback (if provided) when a value becomes available. It can be regarded as a non-blocking version of recv`. While the primary use of this function is to receive values from channels in contexts where being inside an async function is impossible, it can still be used inside async functions at times when it's important that the receive doesn't block the function. The callback is a function of one parameter, and the value supplied for that parameter is the value received from the channel (either a value that was sent or CLOSED). If the callback isn't present, nothing will happen after the value is taken. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description callback module:chanko/channels.OpCallback &lt;optional&gt; A function that gets invoked when a value is made available to be received (this value may be CLOSED if the channel closes with no available value). The function can take one parameter, which is the value that is received from the channel. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 497 &lt;static&gt; recvOrThrow() Receives a value from a channel, blocking the async function until a value becomes available to be received (or until the channel closes with no more values on it to be received). If the received value is an error object, that error is thrown at that point. This function must be called from within an async function and as part of an await expression. It functions in every way like recv except in the case that the value on the channel is an object that has Error.prototype in its prototype chain (any built-in error, any properly-constructed custom error). If that happens, the error is thrown, which will cause the returned promise to be rejected with the error. It can then be handled up the promise chain like any other rejected promise. takeOrThrow is roughly equivalent to: const value = await recv(ch); if (Error.prototype.isPrototypeOf(value)) { throw value; } Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 593 Returns: A promise that will resolve to the value taken from the channel once that take is completed. If the channel closes without a value being made available, this will resolve to CLOSED. If the taken value is an error, the promise will instead be rejected with the error object as the reason. Type Promise &lt;static&gt; select(operations [, options]) Completes the first operation among the provided operations that comes available, blocking the process until then. operations is an array whose elements must be channels or two-element sub-arrays of channels and values, in any combination. An operation that is a channel is a take operation on that channel. An operation that is a two-element array is a put operation on that channel using that value. Exactly one of these operations will complete, and it will be the first operation that unblocks. This function must be called from within an async function and as part of an await expression if the return value is needed. When select is completed and its process unblocks, its await expression evaluates to an object of two properties. The value property becomes exactly what would have been returned by the equivalent await put or await take operation: a boolean in the case of a put, or the taken value in the case of a take. The channel property is set to the channel where the operation actually took place. This will be equivalent to the channel in the operations array which completed first, allowing the process to unblock. If there is more than one operation already available to complete when the call to select is made, the operation with the highest priority will be the one to complete. Regularly, priority is non-deterministic (i.e., it's set randomly). However, if the options object has a priority value set to true, priority will be assigned in the order of the operations in the supplied array. If all of the operations must block (i.e., there are no pending puts for take operations, or takes for put operations), a default value may be returned. This is only done if there is a default property in the options object, and the value of that property becomes the value returned by await select. The channel is set to the special value DEFAULT. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description operations Array.&lt;object&gt; A collection of elements that correspond to recv and send operations. A recv operation is signified by an element that is a channel (which is the channel to be taken from). A send operation is specified by an element that is itself a two-element array, which has a channel followed by a value (which is the channel and value to be sent). options object &lt;optional&gt; {} An optional object which can change the behavior of select through two properties. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description priority boolean &lt;optional&gt; false If true, then the priority of operations to complete when more than one is immediately available is a priority according to position within the operations array (earlier positions have the higher priority). If false or not present, the priorty of operation completion is random. default * &lt;optional&gt; If set and all of the operations initially block, the select call completes immediately with the value of this option (the channel will be DEFAULT). If not set, the select call will block until one of the operations completes and that value and channel will be the ones returned. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/select.js, line 275 Returns: A promise that will resolve to an object of two properties: value will contain the value that would have been returned by the corresponding send or recv operation; and channel will be a reference to the channel that completed the operation to allow select to unblock. Type Promise.&lt;module:chanko/channels.SelectResult&gt; &lt;static&gt; selectAsync(operations, callback [, options]) Completes the first operation among the provided operations that comes available, without blocking. This means that a call to selectAsync does not go into an await expression, and it is not necessary to use it inside a process. Rather than blocking until an operation completes, this one returns immediately and then invokes the callback (if provided) as soon as one of the supplied operations completes. It can be regarded as a non-blocking version of select. This function uses an operations list that's identical to the one used by select. It's an array of values; if a value is a channel, then that operation is a take on that channel, while if it's a two-element array of channel and value, then that operation is a put of that value onto that channel. All options that are available to select are also available here. The callback is a function of one parameter, which in this case is an object with value and channel properties. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description operations Array.&lt;Object&gt; A collection of elements that correspond to recv and send operations. A recv operation is signified by an element that is a channel (which is the channel to be received from). A send operation is specified by an element that is itself a two-element array, which has a channel followed by a value (which is the channel and value to be sent). callback module:chanko/channels.SelectCallback A function that gets invoked when one of the operations completes. options Object &lt;optional&gt; {} An optional object which can change the behavior of selectAsync through two properties. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description priority boolean &lt;optional&gt; false If true, then the priority of operations to complete when more than one is immediately available is a priority according to position within the operations array (earlier positions have the higher priority). If false or not present, the priorty of operation completion is random. default * &lt;optional&gt; If set and all of the operations initially block, the selectAsync calls its callback immediately with the value of this option (the channel will be DEFAULT). If not set, the selectAsync call will not call its callback until one of the operations completes and that value and channel will be the ones returned. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/select.js, line 153 &lt;static&gt; send( [value]) Sends a value to a channel, blocking the async function until that value is received from the channel by a different function (or until the channel closes). A value is always sent to the channel, but if that value isn't specified by the second parameter, it is undefined. Any value may be sent to a channel, with the sole exception of the special value CLOSED. This function must be called from within an async function and as part of an await expression. When send is completed and its function unblocks, its await expression evaluates to a status boolean that indicates what caused the function to unblock. That value is true if the sent value was successfully taken by another process, or false if the unblocking happened because the target channel closed. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description value * &lt;optional&gt; The value being put onto the channel. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 528 Returns: A promise that will resolve to true or false depending on whether the put value is actually taken. Type Promise.&lt;boolean&gt; &lt;static&gt; sendAsync( [value] [, callback]) Sends a value to this channel without blocking. This means that a call to sendAsync does not go into an await expression, and it is not necessary to use it inside a async function. Rather than blocking until the sent value is taken by another async function, this one returns immediately and then invokes the callback (if provided) when the sent value is taken. It can be seen as a non-blocking version of send. While the primary use of this function is to send values onto channels in contexts where being inside an async function is impossible (for example, in a DOM element's event handler), it can still be used inside async functions at times when it's important to make sure that the function doesn't block from the send. The callback is a function of one parameter. The parameter that's supplied to the callback is the same as what is supplied to await send: true if the value was taken, or false if the channel was closed. If the callback isn't present, nothing will happen after the value is taken. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description value * &lt;optional&gt; The value being put onto the channel. callback module:chanko/channels.OpCallback &lt;optional&gt; A function that gets invoked either when the value is taken by another process or when the channel is closed. This function can take one parameter, which is true in the former case and false in the latter. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 463 &lt;static&gt; sleep( [delay]) Blocks the process for the specified time (in milliseconds) and then unblocks it. This implements a delay, but one that's superior to other kinds of delays (setTimeout, etc.) because it blocks the process and allows the dispatcher to allow other processes to run while this one waits. The default delay is 0, which will release the process to allow others to run and then immediately re-queue it. This function must be called from within an async function and as part of an await expression. When this function completes and its process unblocks, the await expression doesn't take on any meaningful value. The purpose of this function is simply to delay, not to communicate any data. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description delay number &lt;optional&gt; 0 the number of milliseconds that the process will block for. At the end of that time, the process is again eligible to be run by the dispatcher. If this is missing or set to 0, the process will cede execution to the next one but immediately requeue itself to be run again. Source: channels/src/modules/process.js, line 44 Returns: A promise that resolves with no meaningful result when the time has elapsed. Type Promise &lt;static&gt; sliding(size) Creates a sliding buffer of the specified capacity. A sliding buffer drops the first-added (oldest) item already in the buffer if a new item is added when the buffer is already at capacity. Since it's always capable of having items added to it, it's never considered full, and therefore a put to a channel buffered by a sliding buffer never blocks. This buffer is passed to chan, etc. to create a buffered channel. It is not meant to be used directly. Parameters: Name Type Description size number The number of items that the new buffer can hold before oldest items are dropped on add. Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 243 Returns: A new sliding buffer of the specified capacity. Type module:chanko/channels.SlidingBuffer &lt;static&gt; timedChan(delay) Creates an unbuffered, timed channel. This channel closes automatically after the supplied number of milliseconds and is the equivalent of calling chan(0, { timer: delay }). Parameters: Name Type Default Description delay number 0 The number of milliseconds after the channel is created that it will be closed automatically. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 362 Returns: A new timed channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; transChan(transducer [, handler]) Creates a buffered channel with a transducer and optional error handler. The buffer for this channel is a FixedBuffer of size 1. This is the equivalent of chan(1, { transducer, handler }). Parameters: Name Type Argument Description transducer module:chanko/channels.Transducer The transducer used to transform values on the new channel. handler module:chanko/channels.ExceptionHandler &lt;optional&gt; An exception handler called with the error object as its only argument when an error happens inside a transducer. If this is not provided, a default handler is used that simply does nothing, including sending no output from the value that errored. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/index.js, line 382 Returns: A new channel with a transducer. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; value(result) A convenience function to read the value out of a select result. This function is not necessary - after all, it's absolutely as correct to simply use result.value instead of value(result), but it's provided for consistency with the rest of the function-centric API. Parameters: Name Type Description result module:chanko/channels.SelectResult The result coming from a select operation. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/select.js, line 292 Returns: The value provided by the select operation. Type * Type Definitions Buffer A buffer that stores values sent to a buffered channel until a process receives them. Different buffer differ only in the way that they determine whether they are full and in what happens when a new value is added to a full buffer. Type: module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer | module:chanko/channels.DroppingBuffer | module:chanko/channels.SlidingBuffer Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 19 Channel A channel, used by processes to communicate with one another. For each operation, the channel first tests to see if there's a corresponding operation already queued (i.e., if we're doing a send that there's a queued recv and vice versa). If there is, that corresponding operation is unblocked and both operations complete. If not, the operation is queued to wait for a corresponding operation. The process or that created the operation then blocks. The channel can be backed by a buffer, though it is not by default. If a buffer is in place, and that buffer is not full, then the process that created an operation that has to be queued is not blocked. This channel object supports transformations, assuming that they follow the protocol created by a few transducer library authors to allow them to interoperate. The support must be explicitly created because the normal method of making an object support transformations won't work here. This method is to create a new object and add the transformed values to it - but for a channel, we need to replace the values on the channel with their transformed values, in the same order even in a multi-process environment. Thus transformations happen in place. Transformations are applied before the value is queued, so even if there is a corresponding operation ready to go, the transformation still happens. Also, transformations require that the channel be buffered (this buffer is what is sent to the transformer's reduction step function); trying to create a channel with a transformer but without a buffer will result in an error being thrown. This is the object that is returned from a call to chan. However, this object is intended to be used as a value to pass to channel operation functions; it doesn't have any properties of interest to an end user. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/handler.js, line 164 DispatcherConfig The configuration of the Chanko dispatcher. An object like this is returned from the module:chanko/channels.config function, and it may also be passed to the same function (though each property is optional in that case). Type: object Properties: Name Type Description batchSize number The maximum number of tasks that the dispatcher will run in a single batch. dispatchMethod Symbol The method used to dispatch a process into a separate line of execution. Source: channels/src/modules/dispatcher.js, line 224 DroppingBuffer A buffer implementation that drops newly added items when the buffer is full. This dropping behavior is silent: the new item is simply not added to the queue. Note that this buffer is never full because it can always be added to without exceeding the size, even if that 'adding' doesn't result in a new item actually appearing in the buffer. Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 145 ExceptionHandler(err) An error handling funciton. This is used to handle exceptions thrown in async functions and in transducers. The return value of an exception handler is typically sent to a channel; if the exception happened within an async function, it will be sent to that function's output channel, and if the excpetion happened in a transducer, it will be sent to the channel to which the transducer is attached. Parameters: Name Type Description err object The error object that was thrown to cause the error to have to be handled. Source: channels/src/index.js, line 46 Returns: A value decided by the handler that will be sent to a channel. Type * FixedBuffer A buffer implementation that never discards buffered items when a new item is added. This buffer has a concept of full, but it's a soft limit. If the size of the buffer is exceeded, added items are still stored. Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 80 OpCallback(value) A callback that's run when a non-blocking channel operation completes. The value that this function receives is identical to what is returned by a blocking call: the value received from the channel for a recv, or true or false depending on the channel status for a send. Any return value from this callback is ignored. Parameters: Name Type Description value * Either the value received from the channel, or whether or not a value was successfully sent. Source: channels/src/index.js, line 61 SelectCallback(data) A callback that's run when a non-blocking select operation completes. The value that this function receives is an object with two properties: the value that the select operation completed with (either the value received from the channel in a receive operation, or true or false in a send operation), along with the channel where the operation actually happened. Any return value from this callback is ignored. Parameters: Name Type Description data module:chanko/channels.SelectResult The value returned from the select operation. Source: channels/src/index.js, line 74 SelectResult A result that comes from select operations. Properties: Name Type Description value * If the select operation resulted in a receive, this is the value received from the channel. If it resulted in a send, this is true for a successful send and false if the channel closed first. channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel upon which the selected operation happened. Source: channels/src/modules/channel/select.js, line 81 SlidingBuffer A buffer implementation that drops the oldest item when an item is added to a full buffer. This is very similar to DroppingBuffer; the only difference is in what happens when an item is added. In this buffer, the new item is indeed added to the buffer, but in order to keep the count of the buffer at or below its size, the oldest item in the buffer is silently dropped. Source: channels/src/modules/buffer.js, line 211 Transducer(xform) A function that transforms data and can be composed with other transducers into a single transducer. The transducers themselves are provided by other libraries; the only involvement of this librar is as a consumer of transducers. Transducers work by having step functions that are known via protocol, and it is these step functions that take a value at a time to be transformed as their arguments. The arguments to the transducers themselves are other transducers that are then composed into a single transducer, which is then returned. These values need not concern a user of ths library; just pass a transducer to chan or transChan and everything else will be handled. Parameters: Name Type Description xform module:chanko/channels.Transducer A transducer to chain this transducer to. Source: channels/src/index.js, line 88 Returns: A new transducer consisting of the composition of this one and xform. Type module:chanko/channels.Transducer Ã— Search results Close "},"module-chanko_operations.html":{"id":"module-chanko_operations.html","title":"Module: chanko/operations","body":" Chanko Modules chanko/channelschanko/operations Module: chanko/operations A set of utility functions that give one or more channels some extra functionality. Each of these accept one or more module:chanko/channels.Channel objects and then combine or manipulate them in (hopefully) useful ways, such as merging them, splitting them, reducing values they receive to a single value, or throttling them so that they only produce one result in a given time period. Source: operations/src/index.js, line 8 Methods &lt;static&gt; debounce(src [, buffer], delay [, options]) Debounces an input channel. Debouncing is the act of turning several input values into one. For example, debouncing a channel driven by a mousemove event would cause only the final mousemove event to be put onto the channel, dropping all of the other ones. This can be desirable because mousemove events come in bunches, being produced continually while the mouse is moving, and often all that we really care about is to learn where the mouse ended up. This function does this by controlling which values that have been sent to the source channel are made available on the destination channel, and when. The delay parameter determines the debounce threshold. Once the first value is sent to the source channel, debouncing is in effect until the number of milliseconds in delay passes without any other value being put onto that channel. In other words, the delay will be refreshed if another value is sent to the source channel before the delay elapses. After a full delay interval passes without a value being sent to the source channel, the last value sent becomes available on the destination channel. This behavior can be modified through four options: leading, trailing, maxDelay, and cancel. If both leading and trailing are true, values will not be duplicated. The first value put onto the source channel will be put onto the destination channel immediately (per leading) and the delay will begin, but a value will only be made available on the destination channel at the end of the delay (per trailing) if another input value was put onto the source channel before the delay expired. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The source channel. buffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; 0 A buffer used to create the destination channel. If this is a number, a FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If this is 0 or not present, the channel will be unbuffered. delay number The debouncing delay, in milliseconds. options Object &lt;optional&gt; {} A set of options to further configure the debouncing. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description leading boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Instead of making a value available on the destination channel after the delay passes, the first value put onto the source channel is made available before the delay begins. No value is available on the destination channel after the delay has elapsed (unless trailing is also true). trailing boolean &lt;optional&gt; true The default behavior, where a value is not made available on the destination channel until the entire delay passes without a new value being put on the source channel. maxDelay number &lt;optional&gt; 0 The maximum delay allowed before a value is put onto the destination channel. Debouncing can, in theory, go on forever as long as new input values continue to be put onto the source channel before the delay expires. Setting this option to a positive number sets the maximum number of milliseconds that debouncing can go on before it's forced to end, even if in the middle of a debouncing delay. Having debouncing end through the max delay operates exactly as if it had ended because of lack of input; the last input is made available on the destination channel (if trailing is true), and the next input will trigger another debounce operation. cancel module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;optional&gt; A channel used to signal a cancellation of the debouncing. Any value put onto this channel will cancel the current debouncing operation, closing the output channel and discarding any values that were waiting for the debounce threshold timer to be sent to the output. Source: operations/src/modules/timing.js, line 96 Returns: The newly-created destination channel, where all of the values will be debounced from the source channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; map(fn, srcs [, buffer]) Maps the values from one or more source channels through a function, sending the results to a new channel. The mapping function is given one value from each source channel, after at least one value becomes available on every source channel. The output value from the function is then sent to the destination channel. The destination channel is created by the function based on the buffer value passed as the third parameter. If this is missing, null, or 0, the destination channel will be unbuffered. If it's a positive integer, the destination channel is buffered by a fixed buffer of that size. If the parameter is a buffer, then that buffer is used to buffer the destination channel. Once any source channel is closed, the mapping ceases and the destination channel is also closed. This is obviously similar to a map transducer, but unlike a transducer, this function works with multiple input channels. This is something that a transducer on a single channel is unable to do. import { go, chan, send, recv, close, isClosed } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { map } from \"@chanko/operations\" const input1 = chan(); const input2 = chan(); const input3 = chan(); const output = map((x, y, z) =&gt; x + y + z, [input1, input2, input3]); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input1, 1); await send(input1, 2); await send(input1, 3); }); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input2, 10); await send(input2, 20); close(input2); }); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input3, 100); await send(input3, 200); await send(input3, 300); }); go(async () =&gt; { console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 111 console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 222 // Output closes now because input2 closes after 2 values console.log(isClosed(output)); // -&gt; true }); Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description fn module:chanko/operations.Mapper The mapping function. This should have one parameter for each source channel and return a single value. srcs Array.&lt;module:chanko/channels.Channel&gt; The source channels. buffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; 0 A buffer used to create the destination channel. If this is a number, a module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If this is 0 or not present, the channel will be unbuffered. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 595 Returns: The destination channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; merge(srcs [, buffer]) Merges one or more channels into a single destination channel. Values are given to the destination channel as they are sent to the source channels. If merge is called when there are already values on multiple source channels, the order that they're put onto the destination channel is random. The destination channel is created by the function based on the buffer value passed as the second parameter. If this is missing, null, or 0, the destination channel will be unbuffered. If it's a positive integer, the destination channel is buffered by a fixed buffer of that size. If the parameter is a buffer, then that buffer is used to buffer the destination channel. As each source channel closes, it is removed from the merge, leaving the channels that are still open to continue merging. When all of the source channels close, then the destination channel is closed. import { go, chan, send, recv } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { merge } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input1 = chan(); const input2 = chan(); const input3 = chan(); const output = merge([input1, input2, input3]); go(async () =&gt; { // Because we're sending to all three channels in the same // process, we know the order in which the values will be // sent to the output channel; in general, we won't know this await send(input1, 1); await send(input2, 2); await send(input3, 3); }); go(async () =&gt; { console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 1 console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 2 console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 3 }); Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description srcs Array.&lt;module:chanko/channels.Channel&gt; An array of source channels. buffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; 0 A buffer used to create the destination channel. If this is a number, a module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If this is 0 or not present, the channel will be unbuffered. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 259 Returns: The destination channel, which will receive all values put onto every source channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; partition(fn, src [, tBuffer] [, fBuffer]) Creates two new channels and routes values from a source channel to them according to a predicate function. The supplied function is invoked with every value that is put onto the source channel. Those that return true are routed to the first destination channel; those that return false are routed to the second. The new channels are created by the function based on the buffer values passed as the third and fourth parameters. If one or both of these are missing, null, or 0, the corresponding destination channel is unbuffered. If one is a positive integer, the corresponding channel is buffered by a fixed buffer of that size. If the parameter for a channel is a buffer, then that buffer is used to buffer the new channel. Both new channels are closed when the source channel is closed. import { go, chan, send, close } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { partition } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = chan(); const ctrl = chan(); const [even, odd] = partition(x =&gt; x % 2 === 0, input, 3, 3); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input, 1); await send(input, 2); await send(input, 3); await send(input, 4); close(input); }); go(async () =&gt; { for await (const value of even) { console.log(value); } await send(ctrl); }); go(async () =&gt; { await recv(ctrl); for await (const value of odd) { console.log(value); } }); // The `ctrl` channel ensures that all of the values on the even channel are // read before any of the values on the odd channel are (this is only // possible because the output channels have buffers big enough to make sure // that no send is blocked). // // -&gt; 2 // -&gt; 4 // -&gt; 1 // -&gt; 3 Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description fn module:chanko/operations.Predicate A predicate function used to test each value on the input channel. src module:chanko/channels.Channel The source channel. tBuffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; 0 A buffer used to create the destination channel which receives all values that passed the predicate. If this is a number, a module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If this is 0 or not present, the channel will be unbuffered. fBuffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; 0 A buffer used to create the destination channel which receives all values that did not pass the predicate. If this is a number, a module:chanko/channels.FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If this is 0 or not present, the channel will be unbuffered. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 187 Returns: An array of two channels. The first is the destination channel with all of the values that passed the predicate, the second is the destination channel with all of the values that did not pass the predicate. Type Array.&lt;module:chanko/channels.Channel&gt; &lt;static&gt; pipe(src, dest [, keepOpen]) Pipes the values from one channel to another channel. This ties two channels together so that puts on the source channel can be taken off the destination channel. This does not duplicate values in any way; if another process takes a value off the source channel, it will never appear on the destination channel. In most cases you will not want to take values off a channel once it's piped to another channel, since it's difficult to know which values will go to which channel. Closing either channel will break the connection between the two. If the source channel is closed, the destination channel will by default also be closed. However, passing true as the third parameter will cause the destination channel to remain open even when the source channel is closed (the connection is still broken however). Because of the ability to leave the destination channel open, a possible use case for this function is to wrap the destination channel(s) of one of the other flow control functions below to have a channel that survives the source channel closing. The rest of those functions (aside from the special-case tap) automatically close their destination channels when the source channels close. import { go, chan, send, recv, close, isClosed } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { pipe } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = chan(); const output = pipe(input, chan()); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input, 1); await send(input, 2); close(input); }); go(async () =&gt; { console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 1 console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 2 console.log(isClosed(output)); // -&gt; true }); Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The source channel. dest module:chanko/channels.Channel The destination channel. keepOpen boolean &lt;optional&gt; false A flag to indicate that the destination channel should be kept open after the source channel closes. By default the destination channel will close when the source channel closes. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 90 Returns: The destination channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; reduce(fn, channel, init) Creates a single value from a channel by running its values through a reducing function. For every value put onto the input channel, the reducing function is called with two parameters: the accumulator that holds the result of the reduction so far, and the new input value. The initial value of the accumulator is the third parameter to reduce. The reduction is not complete until the input channel closes. This function returns a channel. When the final reduced value is produced, it is put onto this channel, and when that value is taken from it, the channel is closed. import { go, chan, send, recv, close } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { reduce } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = chan(); const output = reduce((acc, value) =&gt; acc + value, input, 0); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input, 1); await send(input, 2); await send(input, 3); close(input); }); go(async () =&gt; { const result = await recv(output); console.log(output); // -&gt; 6 }); Note that the input channel must be closed at some point, or no value will ever appear on the output channel. The closing of the channel is what signifies that the reduction should be completed. Parameters: Name Type Description fn module:chanko/operations.Reducer The reducer function responsible for turning the series of channel values into a single output value. channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel whose values are being reduced into a single output value. init * The initial value to feed into the reducer function for the first reduction step. Source: operations/src/modules/conversion.js, line 68 Returns: A channel that will, when the input channel closes, have the reduced value put into it. When this value is taken, the channel will automatically close. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; split(src [, buffers]) Splits a single channel into multiple destination channels, with each destination channel receiving every value sent to the source channel. Every parameter after the first represents the buffer from a single destination channel. Each 0 or null will produce an unbuffered channel, while each positive integer will produce a channel buffered by a fixed buffer of that size. Each buffer will produce a buffered channel backed by that buffer. If there are no parameters after the first, then two unbuffered channels will be produced as a default. When the source channel is closed, all destination channels will also be closed. However, if destination channels are closed, they do nothing to the source channel. import { go, chan, send } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { split } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = chan(); const outputs = split(input, 3); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input, 1); await send(input, 2); await send(input, 3); }); go(async () =&gt; { for await (const output of outputs) { console.log(output); // -&gt; 1 // -&gt; 2 // -&gt; 3 } }); This function moves its values to the output channels asynchronously. This means that even when using unbuffered channels, it is not necessary for all output channels to be received from before the next send to the input channel can complete. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The source channel. buffers number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; 2 The buffers used to create the destination channels. Each entry is treated separately. If one is a number, then a FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If one is a 0, then the corresponding channel will be unbuffered. Exception: if a single number is passed, then that number of unbuferred channels will be created. This means that the default is to create two unbuffered channels. To create a single channel with a fixed buffer, use fixed explicitly. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 337 Returns: An array of destination channels. Type Array.&lt;module:chanko/channels.Channel&gt; &lt;static&gt; tap(src [, dest]) Taps a channel, sending all of the values sent to it to the destination channel. A source channel can be tapped multiple times, and all of the tapping (destination) channels receive each value sent to the tapped (source) channel. This is different from split in that it's temporary. Channels can tap a channel and then untap it, multiple times, as needed. If a source channel has all of its taps removed, then it reverts to a normal channel, just as it was before it was tapped. Also unlike split, each call can only tap once. For multiple channels to tap a source channel, tap has to be called multiple times. Closing either the source or any of the destination channels has no effect on any of the other channels. import { go, chan, send, recv } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { tap } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = chan(); const tapper = chan(); tap(input, tapper); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input, 1); await send(input, 2); }); go(async () =&gt; { console.log(await recv(tapper)); // -&gt; 1 console.log(await recv(tapper)); // -&gt; 2 }); Parameters: Name Type Argument Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel to be tapped. dest module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;optional&gt; The channel tapping the source channel. If this is not present, a new unbuffered channel will be created. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 471 Returns: The destination channel. This is the same as the second argument, if present; otherwise it is the newly-created channel tapping the source channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; throttle(src [, buffer], delay [, options]) Throttles an input channel. Throttling is the act of ensuring that something only happens once per time interval. In this case, it means that a value sent to the source channel is only made available to the destination channel once per a given number of milliseconds. An example usage would be with window scroll events; these events are nearly continuous as scrolling is happening, and perhaps we don't want to call an expensive UI updating function every time a scroll event is fired. We can throttle the input channel and make it only offer up the scroll events once every 100 milliseconds, for instance. Throttling is effected by creating a new channel as a throttled destination for values sent to the source channel. Values will only appear on that destination channel once per delay interval; other values that are put onto the source channel in the meantime are discarded. The delay parameter controls how often a value can become available on the destination channel. When the first value is sent to the source channel, it is immediately sent to the destination channel as well and the delay begins. Any further values sent to the source channel during that delay are not passed through; only when the delay expires is the last input value made available on the destination channel. The delay then begins again, so that further inputs are squelched until that delay passes. Throttling continues, only allowing one value through per interval, until an entire interval passes without input. This behavior can be modified by three options: leading, trailing, and cancel. If both leading and trailing are true, values will not be duplicated. The first value sent to the source channel will be put onto the destination channel immediately (per leading) and the delay will begin, but a value will only be made available on the destination channel at the end of the delay (per trailing) if another input value was sent to the source channel before the delay expired. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The source channel. buffer number | module:chanko/channels.Buffer &lt;optional&gt; 0 A buffer used to create the destination channel. If this is a number, a FixedBuffer of that size will be used. If this is 0 or not present, the channel will be unbuffered. delay number The throttling delay, in milliseconds. options Object &lt;optional&gt; {} A set of options to further configure the throttling. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description leading boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Makes the value that triggered the throttling immediately available on the destination channel before beginning the delay. If this is false, the first value will not be put onto the destination channel until a full delay interval passes. trailing boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Makes the last value put onto the source channel available on the destination channel when the delay expires. If this is false, any inputs that come in during the delay are ignored, and the next value is not put onto the destination channel until the first input after the delay expires. cancel module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;optional&gt; A channel used to signal a cancellation of the throttling. Any value put onto this channel will cancel the current throttling operation, closing the output channel and discarding any values that were waiting for the throttle threshold timer to be sent to the output. Source: operations/src/modules/timing.js, line 222 Returns: } The newly-created destination channel, where all of the values will be throttled from the source channel. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; toArray(channel [, array]) Receives all of the values from a channel and pushes them into an array. If no array is passed to this function, a new (empty) one is created. In effect, this directly converts a channel into an array with the same values. Either way, this operation cannot complete until the input channel is closed. This function returns a channel. When the final array is produced, it is sent to this channel, and when that value is received from it, the channel is closed. import { go, chan, send, recv, close } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { toArray } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = chan(); const output = toArray(input); go(async () =&gt; { await send(input, 1); await send(input, 2); await send(input, 3); close(input); }); go(async () =&gt; { const result = await recv(output); console.log(result); // -&gt; [1, 2, 3] }); Note that the input channel must be closed at some point, or no value will ever appear on the output channel. The closing of the channel is what signifies that all of the values needed to make the array are now available. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description channel module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel from which values are received to put into the array. array array &lt;optional&gt; The array to put the channel values into. If this is not present, a new, empty array will be created. Source: operations/src/modules/conversion.js, line 176 Returns: A channel that will, when the input channel closes, have the array of channel values put onto it. When this array is received, the channel will automatically close. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; toChannel(iterable [, channel]) Sends all values from an iterable to the supplied channel. If no channel is passed to this function, a new channel is created. In effect, this directly converts an iterable into a channel with the same values on it. The channel is closed after the final iterable value is sent to it. This function will convert any JavaScript object that implements the iterable protocol. In other words, if it works in a for...of statement, it will work here. import { go, chan, recv, isClosed } from \"@chanko/channels\"; import { toChannel } from \"@chanko/operations\"; const input = [1, 2, 3]; const output = toChannel(input); go(async () =&gt; { console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 1 console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 2 console.log(await recv(output)); // -&gt; 3 console.log(isClosed(output)); // -&gt; true }); Parameters: Name Type Argument Description iterable iterable The iterable containing the values to be sent to the channel. channel module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;optional&gt; The channel onto which to put all of the array elements. If this is not present, a new channel will be created. Source: operations/src/modules/conversion.js, line 121 Returns: the channel onto which the array elements are put. This is the same as the input channel, but if no input channel is specified, this will be a new channel. It will close when the final value is taken from it. Type module:chanko/channels.Channel &lt;static&gt; untap(src, dest) Untaps a previously tapping destination channel from its source channel. This removes a previously created tap. The destination (tapping) channel will stop receiving the values sent to the source channel. If the destination channel was not, in fact, tapping the source channel, this function will do nothing. If all taps are removed, the source channel reverts to normal (i.e., it no longer has the tapping code applied to it and can be taken from as normal). Parameters: Name Type Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The tapped channel. dest module:chanko/channels.Channel The channel that is tapping the source channel that should no longer be tapping the source channel. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 497 &lt;static&gt; untapAll(src) Removes all taps from a source channel. The previously-tapped channel reverts to a normal channel, while any channels that might have been tapping it no longer receive values from the source channel. If the source channel had no taps, this function does nothing. Parameters: Name Type Description src module:chanko/channels.Channel The tapped channel. All taps will be removed from this channel. Source: operations/src/modules/flow.js, line 521 Type Definitions Mapper(values) A function that maps its input(s) to an output value. It takes a variable number of input values and calculates an output value from them. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description values * &lt;repeatable&gt; The input values. Source: operations/src/index.js, line 43 Returns: An output value calculated from the input values. Type * Predicate(value) A function that takes a single value and, depending on whether that value meets the function's criteria for passing, returns true or false. Parameters: Name Type Description value * The value to test. Whether or not the value passes the test depends on the criteria established by the predicate. Source: operations/src/index.js, line 32 Returns: Either true if the value passes or false if it doesn't. Type boolean Reducer(acc, value) A function that integrates one of its values into the other. It's used for reducing channel values into a single value. Parameters: Name Type Description acc * The current accumulated value. value * The new value that needs to be integrated into the accumulated value. Source: operations/src/index.js, line 53 Returns: A new accumulated value, resulting from integrating value into the original accumulated value. Type * Ã— Search results Close "}}
